<h1>C - Bit Manipulation</h1>

## Bit manipulation in C involves performing various bitwise operations on individual bits or groups of bits within the data value 

### There are six bit operators. They are:
| Bit Operator | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
|`&`| **AND** Operator. Determines whether two bits are the same or not. Returns 1 at bit position if both corresponding bit is 1, else 0.|
|`\|`| **OR** Operator. Determines whether two bits are different or not. Returns  1 at bit position if either of the corresponding bit is 1, else 0.|
|`^`| **XOR** Operator. Determines whether two bits are different. Returns 1 if only one of the corresponding bits is 1, else 0. Also known as Exclusive OR.|   
|`~`| **NOT** Operator. Takes a bit and switches to what it is not. 1's would be 0 and 0's would be 1's.|
|`<<` & `>>`|**LEFT** and **RIGHT** Shift Operators. Shifts the bits either left or right by the number of positions specificed after the operator.|
